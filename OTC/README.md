# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.ts
```
```
nvm use v18.0.0
npx hardhat

//编译合约
npx hardhat compile
```
